Have you ever started a project not knowing what in the world you were doing? Well not having a single bit of web development experience I decided to do just that. 


Though I would not say I have a burning passion to become a web developer now, but do plan on continuing to add to this site. I have come across a new found respect (and a little annoyance) for the realm of web development.

designed to tackle a task that turned into a significantly more complected than I thought (arguably my own doing).

I have learned much more about web development than I really have cared to. Though I have come out out of this project with more respect for web development.

over a year of periodic work I am happy with what I have been able to make. Though far from perfect and I don't think I will be becoming a web developer anytime soon 

I have learned a lot of how not to design a website.

has was started a little over a year ago and has grown now into what it is. Over this past year I have not been solely working on this project  



This website is my first entry into web development. Definitly not a passion though necisary for understanding how to get information out in this era.

This project has been quite a learning experience for me

## Lessons Learned

In the future I
