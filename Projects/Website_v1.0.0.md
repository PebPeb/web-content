Title: BryceKeen.com (How Not to Build a Website)

Just over a year ago I started this project not knowing a single thing about web development. Going from not knowing a thing to now making my first official release (a little arbitrary since I am the only one working on it) it has been quite the big milestone for me. Though to be honest, web development is definitely not my forte. I have made my fair share of mistakes, and learned some important engineering techniques the hard way and will definitely be carrying them over to my next projects. One other thing that I have gained from this project is a new found respect for web developers and touch of annoyance to. As for me though, I think I will be sticking to working with low level systems.

## BryceKeen.com v1.0.0

This website was made from scratch as a project aimed for hosting my different projects and things that are interesting to me. The tools to accomplish this were selected primarily out of ignorance of the realm of web development. Though each tool was added gradually at the time to solve a specific problem. The end result was an unnecessarily complex system. Now presenting [BryceKeen.com](https://brycekeen.com).

It was definitely a exciting challenge and I am proud of the outcome 

in the world of web development. 


This over one year of 

not knowing what in the world I was doing... Presto I have a website.

With over one year of periodic work I am happy with the current state of this website. Even with its long list of problems

over a year of periodic work I am happy with what I have been able to make. Though far from perfect and I don't think I will be becoming a web developer anytime soon 

I have learned a lot of how not to design a website.

has was started a little over a year ago and has grown now into what it is. Over this past year I have not been solely working on this project  



This website is my first entry into web development. Definitly not a passion though necisary for understanding how to get information out in this era.

This project has been quite a learning experience for me 

Some of the lessons I have learned

## 

React
Pelican
Python
Pygments
Jinja2
Webpack


## Lessons Learned

In the future I 

- Not the simplest solution (maybe because a lack of knowledge)
- Try to stick to one technology (Python like templates or Django)
- Wordpress for more professional use 

## Purpose

As this site is personal to me I find it important to list my purpose and what I hope to accomplish though it.

1. Challenge myself and others to learn new things.
2. Improve my ability to communicate as an educator.
3. Challenge my creativity as an engineer and a presenter.
4. Demonstrate **God** through all my work.

Proverbs 14:23 - "In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty"
