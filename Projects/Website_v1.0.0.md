Title: Building BryceKeen.com v1.0.0

Category: Project

Just over a year ago I started this project not knowing a single bit of web development. From not knowing anything to now making my first official release (a little arbitrary since I am the only one working on it) it is quite a big milestone for me. To be honest it was a good experience though web development is not for me. A made a lot of mistakes and found my self learning a lot unexpected engineering lessons along the way. One of the biggest things I have taken away from this stage of the project is my new found respect and a little annoyance for web developers.


## BryceKeen.com

I know what you are thinking "Cool an image of the website that I am currently on". Though it could not be I don't what this site could look like a year from now thats why I added it.

It was definitely a exciting challenge and I am proud of the outcome 

in the world of web development. 


This over one year of 

not knowing what in the world I was doing... Presto I have a website.

With over one year of periodic work I am happy with the current state of this website. Even with its long list of problems

over a year of periodic work I am happy with what I have been able to make. Though far from perfect and I don't think I will be becoming a web developer anytime soon 

I have learned a lot of how not to design a website.

has was started a little over a year ago and has grown now into what it is. Over this past year I have not been solely working on this project  



This website is my first entry into web development. Definitly not a passion though necisary for understanding how to get information out in this era.

This project has been quite a learning experience for me 

Some of the lessons I have learned

## 

React
Pelican
Python
Pygments
Jinja2
Webpack


## Lessons Learned

In the future I 

- Not the simplest solution (maybe because a lack of knowledge)
- Try to stick to one technology (Python like templates or Django)
- Wordpress for more professional use
