Title: Testing File

This is a testing file. Not much to it.

But I am going to write a little so that I can look at how the website is building these types of things. I need to check a lot of the functions that markdown allows for. This is so that I can see how this is being built and how Pelican is building my web content. This is going to be my first post. What I need to go and do next is try an add an image to this. Next link other posts or projects in this one. I need to test lists and charts.

``` python
def myfunction()
  print('testing')
```

This is an `inline test`.
